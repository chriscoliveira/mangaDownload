The Curses run rampant throughout the world, capable of leading people to terrible misfortune and even death. What&#39;s more, the Curses can only be exorcised by another Curse.<br><br>Itadori Yuji is a boy with tremendous physical strength, though he lives a completely ordinary high school life. One day, to save a friend who has been attacked by Curses, he eats the finger of the Double-Faced Specter, taking the Curse into his own soul. From then on, he shares one body with the Double-Faced Specter. Guided by the most powerful of sorcerers, Gojou Satoru, Itadori is admitted to the Tokyo Metropolitan Technical High School of Sorcery, an organization that fights the Curses... and thus begins the heroic tale of a boy who became a Curse to exorcise a Curse, a life from which he could never turn back.<br><br>(Source: Crunchyroll)<br><br><span class=\"italics\">Note: The first episode received an early web premiere on September 19th, 2020.

Instead, they operate in the shadows and pull the strings of society through wit and cleverness. That\u2019s the role Cid wants to play when he\u2019s transported to another world. Cid spins a yarn or three and becomes the unlikely leader of the underground Shadow Garden organization that fights against a menacing cult (which he totally made up). However, there\u2019s a catch even his wild imagination didn\u2019t see coming: the cult he concocted actually exists, and they\u2019re beyond displeased that his power fantasy just got in the way of their evil plans!<br><br>(Source: HIDIVE)",
